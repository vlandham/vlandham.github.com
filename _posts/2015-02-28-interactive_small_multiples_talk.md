Based around the findings of my [linked small multiples tutorial](http://vallandingham.me/linked_small_multiples.html) - I gave a talk about different types of interactions you can use with small multiples and how you might build one yourself.

Check out the [slides here](http://vallandingham.me/small_mults_talk/)

I gave this talk at [Bocoup](http://bocoup.com/) (to silence-is-golden rave reviews).

I love talking about awesome visualization techniques like small multiples. If I can present this to your group - let me know!
