Want some more data visualization attempts, studies, and undertakings? Check out my new [Experiments Section](http://vallandingham.me/experiments/)

Here you will find an ever growing list of half-baked projects and hair-brained ideas.

As a bonus, I’ve whipped up a little tag-based navigational tool for finding what you are interested in, faster.

[Most of the code for these little projects is easily accessible](https://github.com/vlandham/experiments) - just in case anyone wants to explore an idea further.

Check back often to discover what I have been experimenting with lately.
