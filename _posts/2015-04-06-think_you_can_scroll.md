This April, I had the privilege of coming back to [OpenVis Conf](http://openvisconf.com/) for a second time as a presenter. This is doublely special for me as I recently became an [Open Web Engineer](http://bocoup.com/weblog/author/jim-vallandingham/) at Bocoup - the organizers of this great conference (though it was after they had already accepted my talk).

## Video

Check out the video [on youtube](https://youtu.be/fYQGgaE_b4I):

or on the [OpenVis Conf Site](https://openvisconf.com/2015/).

## Slides

The slides for the talk [are online](http://vallandingham.me/scroll_talk/) - but because of all the videos used, this can talk quite a while to load remotely.

</div>

Alternatively, you can [clone the talk repo](https://github.com/vlandham/scroll_talk), and get all the content on your own machine!

## Examples

Perhaps, more usefully, I've collected the examples used in the talk, and some that didn't make it in but are still awesome, as an [examples page](http://vallandingham.me/scroll_talk/examples/).

## Code

**Update: I've updated this code to use D3v4. Please Enjoy!**

The [demo application](http://vallandingham.me/scroll_demo) and [associated tutorial](http://vallandingham.me/scroller.html) can also be found on my site.

And of course, make your own scrolling art with [embroiden](http://vallandingham.me/embroiden/) - my fun little bookmarklet.

Hope these resources are useful to you!
